# 📊 Student Data Analysis (Week 3 Project)

This project is part of my coding and data analysis learning journey.  
The goal was to clean, analyze, and visualize student performance data using Python (Pandas + Matplotlib).

---

## 🔹 Project Steps
1. Data Cleaning
   - Removed extra spaces from names.
   - Converted names to title case.
   - Standardized class labels (SS1, SS2…).
   - Fixed inconsistent score formats (e.g., `65,5 → 65.5`).

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Summary statistics (mean, median, min, max).
   - Grouped averages by class.
   - Checked score distributions.

3. Visualizations
   - Pie chart of grade distribution.
   - Histogram of scores.
   - Bar chart of grade counts.
   - Combo plots (class vs total scores).

## 🔹 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🔹 Files
- student_analysis.ipynb → Notebook with the code and analysis.  
- students_clean.csv → Clean dataset used in the project.  

---

## 🔹 Next Steps
- Automate grade calculation from raw scores.
- Add more visualizations (boxplots, scatter plots).
- Upload more projects as I progress in my learning journey 🚀.
